In step 1 eprom types are selected, which is self-explanatory.
(The 27256s sometimes have a quirk; some have some continuity between pin 28 (5V) and pin 1 (Vpp). When using a 27512
pin 1 is not hardwired to 5V, but is the A15 of the 27512 and connected to the D register (741LS174).
This can (must not) lead to problems with the voltage level of the low signal, which is with 0.8Volt higher than 0.4Volt and is at the limit of the
voltage level which defines logical zero. So you should check the 27256s if they are "high impedance" between pin 28 and pin 1 or use 27512s only).

In step 2 the base address can be changed. Jumper J1 and J2 is the IO area $DE00, $DF00 and self-explanatory.
Jumpers J3, J4, J5, J6 are XOR-gated with A4, A5, A6, A7 respectively and determine the range in $10 increments, i.e. $DE00, $DE10, etc.

Step 3 Selection of the drive with SPACE and SHIFT RETURN

Step 4 Select the programs from the source disk.
The programs which should be on the module are moved from the left to the right side with RETURN.
Confirm the selection with SHIFT RETURN. The generator then checks if the eprom space is sufficient.
If the next source disk is requested but you don't want to have any more programs, you have to cancel with the ARROW LEFT key (top left).

Step 5. then FILES ON EPROM appears and you have to move files from left to right again. With CURSORRIGHT CURSORLINKS
you can switch between OLD and NEW and with CURSEROBEN CURSERUNTEN and RETURN you can change the order.

Step 6: Then the selection of the start addresses appears. With SPACE you enter the editing mode. With RETURN the input is accepted.
Programs which start at $8000 and are provided with module start are started with SYS 64738, i.e. $FCE2.
At the same time, F2 to F6 can be used to change the block graphic, frame color, background color, bar color,
font color. Terrible combinations are possible here.

Step 7. eprom files are created, instructions are shown below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The populated module is started by pressing a key.

CURSOR up/down is used to scroll. F1 and F7 scroll one page.

SPACE loads a program without starting it, programs with autostart ( greater $00FF less $0400) must be started with SPACE.

RETURN loads and starts a program.

RUN/STOP switch off BRAINY.

RESTORE triggers a conventional reset, module start programs ($8000) are started automatically.

SHIFT is only effective in conjunction with one of the functions described above. It restores the program currently in memory (OLD function).
